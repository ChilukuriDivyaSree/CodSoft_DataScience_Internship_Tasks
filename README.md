Projects(Tasks) related to Data Science Internship.

Task-1 : TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
* Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a
  passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner
  project with readily available data.
* The dataset typically used for this project contains information
  about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket
  class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

Task-2 : MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON
* Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on
  features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression
  techniques to tackle this problem.
* The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model
  that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or
  critics.
* Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data
  analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine
  learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors
  that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that
  can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.

Task-3 : Sales Prediction using Python
* Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that
  customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as
  advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and
  advertising platform selection.
* In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data
  Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machine
  learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing
  them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By
  leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their
  advertising strategies and maximize sales potential. Let's
  embark on the journey of sales prediction using machine learning in Python.

Task-4 : Credit Card Fraud Detection
* Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card
  transactions.
* Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class
  imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random
  forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
* Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,
  and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or
  undersampling for improving results.
